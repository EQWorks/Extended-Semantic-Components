# Extended Semantic Components

This is a collection of components that we've extended based on [Semantic UI React](https://react.semantic-ui.com/) that are commonly used in many of our projects at [EQ Works](https://www.eqworks.com/), such as [ATOM](https://overlord.eqworks.io/), and [Locus](https://console.locus.place/).

You can see the components in action at <https://eqworks.github.io/extended-semantic-components>

```
$ npm install @eqworks/extended-semantic-components
```

And to use it within your project

  SemanticDatePicker,
  DataTable,
} = import '@eqworks/extended-semantic-components'

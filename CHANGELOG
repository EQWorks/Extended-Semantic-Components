## [Unreleased]

## [2.1.0] - 2019-01-28
### Added
- Pickable columns for `DataTable`.
- `DataTable` property `perPage` for maximum number of rows per page when pagination is triggered, defaults to its previously hardcoded value 9.
- `DataTable` property `columns` as an alternative of `children` (`DataTable.Column`) for a simpler way to define composable columns through simple Array manipulations. Only one of `children` or `columns` property is allowed.

### Changed
- Zero searchable columns would be used to determine whether to render `DataTable` control section (along with existing ones).
- Yarn based lock.

### Fixed
- `DataTable`: Search when cell data is `null` or `undefined`.

### Removed
- `search` property for `DataTable` is no longer effective. Use `searchable` for `DataTable.Column` instead. This is not considered to be a breaking change since they were meant to be used in conjunction.

## [2.0.2] - 2019-01-21
### Changed
- Pure Babel based transpile instead of Parcel based build for `npm publish`.

### Removed

## [Unreleased]

## [2.3.2] - 2019-03-15
### Fixed
- `DataTable` crashing bug with empty dataset. (https://github.com/EQWorks/extended-semantic-components/issues/37)

## [2.3.1] - 2019-03-12
### Added
- `DataTable` customizable search interface

### Fixed
- `DataTable` defaultSortKey not taking effect due to lack of sortType
- `DataTable` string type sort crash on non-string `(a, b)` values.
- `DataTable` string type sort reversed order ('ascending' resulting in 'descending').

## [2.2.0] - 2019-03-01
### Added
- `DataTable` able to download to honour user picked columns.
- `DataTable` Tokenized search feature.
- Zero config `DataTable`.
- Working storybook of `DateRangePicker`.

### Fixed
- `DataTable` A bug caused by doing search while not in the first page.

## [2.1.0] - 2019-01-28
### Added
- Pickable columns for `DataTable`.
- `DataTable` property `perPage` for maximum number of rows per page when pagination is triggered, defaults to its previously hardcoded value 9.
- `DataTable` property `columns` as an alternative of `children` (`DataTable.Column`) for a simpler way to define composable columns through simple Array manipulations. Only one of `children` or `columns` property is allowed.
- `DataTable` property `defaultSortDir` to specify starting sort direction
- `DataTableColumn` properties `sortable` (default is `true`) and `sortType` (default is `string`) added

### Changed
- Zero searchable columns would be used to determine whether to render `DataTable` control section (along with existing ones).
- Yarn based lock.
- sorting previously done by lodash `orderBy`, now changed to custom sort functions of type `date`, `string` and `basic` (number) to allow for more flexible column sorting

### Fixed
- `DataTable`: Search when cell data is `null` or `undefined`.

### Removed
- `search` property for `DataTable` is no longer effective. Use `searchable` for `DataTable.Column` instead. This is not considered to be a breaking change since they were meant to be used in conjunction.
